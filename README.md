My problem is that if I call main.html I get the buttons and functionality, if I use the .js script by adding the source, I don't see anything on screen...

Elm html: [main.elm](out/main.html)

Elm js: [main.js](out/main_js.html)

Does anyone have any idea what changes should I do to make the main_js.html work?
